# Streampal
Free Streaming Website called StreamPal which doesnt host any files directly on its site.

# Current Features
- Bookmarks
- Show all
- Scroll layout like netflix to help reduce the need for multiple pages
- All designed within a single html file not constantly loading a new site for each Tv show or Movies all contained within one Site which is StreamPal
- Sandboxed Embedded Video Players
- Non Sandboxed Embedded Video Players
- Spiders and Scrapes Using public apis to gather additional video player server providers!
- Tv Section is complete! besides the genre section
- Search Bar is fully functionable and Complete! so you can search any movie that is in the TMDB.

# Coming Soon Features
- Watch Later List aka Watch List incase you dont want to bookmark but might want to peep somethings out without cluttering your bookmarks!
- Watch History
- Movies Section 
- Movie Genre Section
- And maybe a few other things also we include a Documentation page for anyone who wants to become a file provider without having to have a server using IPFS network but this service isnt complete
- Once the Tools are completed like a script to help auto add to ipfs file folders and publish for you etc.. along with The File Structure Generator Tool which will help generate the Folder structures properly
- Along with including URL list editor tool to help with providing URLS for the sources and eventually i imagine someone will take this strucuture design and automate the upload of files and storing of urls to be a URL provider



# Our Goals
- We wish to decentralize video streaming of movies and tv shows along with making it as mobile friendly as netflix or plutotv or tubi but instead of using a app you can do it straight through the browser
- We hope to be able to cut down loads of ads by sandboxing the embedded video players but sadly some servers detect sandbox so for those servers we recommend using the Brave browser
- We hope you enjoy our site and as always we wish to remain as legal as possible which is why we dont directly host any content which is listed on our website so we don't break any copyright infringment.
- Along with the fact the site is nothing more then a video search engine for movies and tv shows amongst publicly known servers using custom search algorithms


# Disclaimer
- All Files and Content/Videos/Pictures displayed on the site is not directly hosted by or associated with StreamPal in any means or anyway so please be sure to reach out to each Individual File Providers for our services if you have any issues with a File or Content/Video/Picture that they may have posted!
